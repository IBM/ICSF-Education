Sample SMF30 crypto counters processing tool
This sample tool has 2  components:
•	SMF30CEX: A JCL to run the Rexx program and provide the files required for its execution.
•	SMF30CRY: A Rexx program, processing SMF30 records and extracting the crypto counters.
The Rexx program will dynamically parse the SYS1.MACLIB IFASMFCN and extract the label for each reported crypto instruction id.
The JCL will require the following customization:
1.	Replace hlq.report.csv with the name of the output dataset to contain the extracted SMF30 crypto counters fields in CSV format.
2.	Replace hlq.smfdata.input with the name of the input dataset containing SMF30 records.
3.	The MACLIB DD should be updated, if required, to provide the location of the IFASMFCN macro in SYS1.MACLIB.
4.	The SYSEXEC DD should  be updated to provide the location of the library where the SMF30CRY rexx program has been uploaded.
